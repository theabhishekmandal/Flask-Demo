'''
 In this flask demo we will create the entry page of our html through flask

 Flask comes with a function called render_template which, when provided with the name of a
template and any required arguments, returns a string of HTML when invoked. To use
render_template , add its name to the list of imports from the flask module (at the top of your
code), then invoke the function as needed.

  render_template contains arguments such as one is the html page, the other arguments can be
  the default arguments of the html page

- for this we will define a method which will return a html document which we have created
- But after entering the values in the html document we will find that it will show some error
  error no.405
- The 405 status code indicates that the client (your browser) sent a request using a HTTP method
  which this server doesnâ€™t allow
